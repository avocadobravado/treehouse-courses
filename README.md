# _Treehouse course replica_

#### Week 1 Project - CSS

#### By **Rose Sponseller and Daniel Lopez, Wednesday May 24, 2017**

## Description

This site is a replica of a list of courses from `teamtreehouse.com`. No images were used in the making of the site. The icons are from `FontAwesome.io`. The user icon was created with a border radius with four different border icons. The "7" over the bell notification was created using the `:after` pseudoelement.

The courses are positioned side by side using the `float` property.
